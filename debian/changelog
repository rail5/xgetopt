xgetopt (0.9.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Constexpr all the things: Build getopt_long arrays at compile-time
    The options and all their information are known at compile-time,
    therefore there's nothing stopping us from building the shortopt
    and longopt arrays needed by GNU getopt at compile-time in .rodata
    instead of building them on the stack at runtime when parse() is
    called.
  * Minor change: include <cstddef> for size_t definition
