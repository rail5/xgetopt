xgetopt (0.11.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Refactor:
    Implemented compile-time calculation of help string buffer size.
    Use FixedString and OptionView for constexpr string and option handling.
    Removed legacy Option and FixedString implementations.
    Improved internal option label formatting logic.
  * Added support for argument placeholders in help output (e.g., <file> for
    output).
  * Added getOptions() method to retrieve defined options.
  * Improved help string formatting:
    Required arguments now display as <placeholder>.
    Optional arguments for long options display as [=placeholder], matching GNU
    conventions.
    Descriptions now wrap at 80 characters for better readability.
  * No breaking changes to runtime parsing behavior.

xgetopt (0.9.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Constexpr all the things: Build getopt_long arrays at compile-time
    The options and all their information are known at compile-time,
    therefore there's nothing stopping us from building the shortopt
    and longopt arrays needed by GNU getopt at compile-time in .rodata
    instead of building them on the stack at runtime when parse() is
    called.
  * Minor change: include <cstddef> for size_t definition
